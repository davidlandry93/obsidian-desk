# Desk for Obsidian

**Desk** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that lets you
choose some of your notes and see them together, at a glance.
The notes are laid down in a 4x6 aspect ratio which is 
typically used in analog Zettelkasten systems. 
The inspiration for this plugin is to emulate picking up the cards for a particular topic, and laying them down on a desk.
To learn more about the rationale behind the plugin, read [this post](https://blog.dlandry.xyz/posts/obsidian_desk/).

## Installation

### Through community plugins

The easiest way to install this plugin is through Obsidian's community plugins. 
Desk will be available there as soon as the initial code review is finished.

### Manual installation

Download the `manifest.json`, `main.js` and `style.css` files from the [lastest release](https://github.com/davidlandry93/obsidian-desk/releases), and 
copy them in the `<vault_directory>/.obsidian/plugins/desk`.

### Dependencies

This plugin requires the [Obsidian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin to be installed. 
The **Enable Javascript Queries** option must be enabled for Dataview.

## Usage

Once enabled, the plugin adds a desk lamp icon in the left ribbon.
Click on the icon to open a new desk.
Alternatively, use the *Create new desk* command from the command palette to create a new desk.

Type in the search box to browse through your available filters.
Desk for Obsidian can filter you notes by outgoing links, incoming links, string, tag and directories. 
You can make a exclusion filter by clicking on a filter after it was added.

Click on a note card to expand it and see the full note.

Feel free to scale your Obsidian UI up and down to see more of less notes at the same time.
